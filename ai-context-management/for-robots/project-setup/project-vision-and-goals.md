# Project Vision & Goals

## What We’re Building
An iOS app that’s a simple soundboard: a grid of square buttons; tapping a button plays a sound out loud.

## Why We’re Building It
- Personal utility first (fast access to commonly used sounds).
- A foundation that can evolve into a shareable app for others.

## Who It’s For
- Primary: you (the creator) as the initial user.
- Future: anyone who wants a lightweight, customizable soundboard.

## MVP Scope (Initial Release)
- A fixed set of sound buttons.
- Simple grid UI with tappable square buttons.
- Reliable audio playback through the device speaker (respecting iOS audio behavior).

## Aspirational / Future Capabilities
- User-created custom buttons with user-provided sounds (import/record).
- Button customization (title, icon/color, reorder).

## Non-Goals (For Now)
- Accounts, cloud sync, sharing/community marketplace.
- Complex editing tools or advanced audio processing.
