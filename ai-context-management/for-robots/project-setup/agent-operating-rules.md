<!-- PROJECT SETUP FILE - These rules guide how the AI should work on this repo. -->

# Agent Operating Rules

## Communication
- Ask a brief clarifying question when requirements are ambiguous.
- Keep responses concise and action-oriented.

## Safety
- Don’t delete or rewrite large parts of the project without asking.
- Don’t run networked commands without approval (network is restricted).
- Prefer minimal, reversible changes.

## Quality Bar
- Keep changes consistent with existing style.
- Add lightweight validation (build/tests) when feasible.

## Workflow Preferences
- Create small, incremental commits only if explicitly requested.
- Document decisions in the AI context files when they materially affect the project.
- Ask before introducing new third-party dependencies or build tooling.
