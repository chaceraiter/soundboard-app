# Current Work Focus

## Project Goal (Big Picture)
Build a simple iOS soundboard app with a clean grid of tappable buttons that play sounds, with a path to future user customization.

## Intermediate Goal (Milestone)
Ship an MVP: a fixed set of bundled sounds playable via a grid UI.

## Current Task (Immediate)
Run the prototype in Xcode and iterate: add real sound assets, refine the grid/button styling, and confirm audio session behavior.
